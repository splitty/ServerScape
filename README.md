# ServerScape
Universal Steam Server Connector

### What it does-

  * Directly connects to any steam game server.
  * Admins of servers can create their own server files using simple XML
  * Users can get updates on server status, ping, and a message from admins pulled from a website every time.  
  * No login for steam needed, it runs along side of your steam client.

### Best Practices For Admins- 
 * Update message and XML sheet regularly.
 * Properly format XML using tags and TABS.
  
### How-
 * ServerScape uses the connect function of the steam client to launch the game associated with IP and Port of the XML file.  Loading and unloading of XML can be handled within the application and a few clicks.  Mods needed are also viewed from a list in the Mods tab.  Simply click connect and you will join whatever server your admin has set the XML file to.
